# Movie_analytics
Leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, 
I explored and analyzed a comprehensive dataset of movies using Python. <br><br>
The dataset contained various attributes such as movie name, rating, genre, release year, budget, gross earnings, and more. Leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, 
I conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing, handling missing data, and identifying outliers.<br>
My analysis included in-depth statistical techniques, including Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman correlations, to understand the relationships between different features. Through visualizations like histograms and scatter plots, I uncovered fascinating insights and trends in the data, facilitating informed decision-making. Notably.<br><br>
I detected and addressed outliers, ensuring the integrity of the analysis. <br>
My project demonstrates the power of data analysis in uncovering actionable insights and has equipped me with valuable skills in data manipulation and visualization.
